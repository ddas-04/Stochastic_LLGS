### The code in this folder can be used for simulating the stochastic LLG (sLLG), where the switching can be done by the effective magnetic field.
### The parameters are taken from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11732-w.pdf. Here, the effective magnetic field contains the uniaxial anisotropy field, Demag field, and Magnetoelectric (ME) field. 
### Note that in the above nature paper, there is a typo in the ME field (Eq. (7) in the paper). 'mz' term in the z-component of the ME field should be omitted.
### H_ME=(0,0,alpha*(V_IN/t_ME)). 
### This is taken care in the code
